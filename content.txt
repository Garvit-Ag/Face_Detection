OpenCV is an image processing library created by Intel

A Haar Cascade Classifier is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in
images or video streams. It uses Haar-like features to detect objects based on their shape and appearance.
Haar Cascades are commonly used for tasks such as face detection, pedestrian detection, and object recognition
in images and videos.

A grayscale image is an image where each pixel value represents the intensity of light at that point,
typically ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
