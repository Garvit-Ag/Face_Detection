Project Overview:
This project involves developing a real-time face detection system using the OpenCV library in Python and the Haar Cascade classifier. The objective is to create a robust system capable of detecting faces in live video feeds from a webcam. This project can serve as a foundational step for more complex applications like facial recognition, emotion detection, or augmented reality.

Key Features:
Real-Time Face Detection: The system captures video feed from a webcam and detects faces in real time.
Haar Cascade Classifier: Utilizes pre-trained Haar cascades for detecting faces, which are efficient and quick for real-time applications.
OpenCV Integration: Leverages the powerful computer vision library OpenCV for video processing and face detection.
